# Card Maker for Anki
In the base of this module are [**anki-connect**](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect) 
and [**reverso_context_api**](https://github.com/flagist0/reverso_context_api) modules. As its core functionality,
Card Maker searches an english word on https://dictionaryapi.dev/ then gets the word's data
(translation, transcription, several definitions, link to an audio file with pronunciation sample). Translations
and usage examples are taken from https://context.reverso.net/translation/.
